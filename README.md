Still haven't figured out

In my opinion just 5% is done.
Locally it is working but i need to figure out the way that i can do with dynamic ip address.


Probably I am going to use LogMeIn Strategy, vpn and vlc and so on...

Anyway, currently I am working on the configuration Setup part which edits the windows hosts file.

Will be only working with windows for now.
